# Axon-cars-sales-Report
Overview In this project, I tackled a critical challenge faced by Axon, a classic car retailer. Axon's sales team struggled with managing and making sense of their sales data due to a lack of a centralized system. The absence of accurate and up-to-date sales reports hindered effective decision-making.

To address these issues, I try to implement a robust Business Intelligence (BI) solution using Microsoft PowerBI and SQL.

Project Objectives The primary objectives of this project were:

Data Integration: Import and integrate data from the MySQL database into PowerBI. Data Preparation: Clean and transform the data to ensure its readiness for analysis. Data Modeling: Create a data model within PowerBI to establish relationships between different data tables and optimize data retrieval for analysis. Interactive Dashboards: Develop interactive dashboards and reports using PowerBI to assist the sales team and management in interpreting the data. Advanced Analytics: Utilize SQL for advanced analytics to extract insights that can improve sales. Real-time Access: Enable real-time access to dashboards and reports for informed, data-driven decisions. The success of the project was measured by the effectiveness of the BI solution in enhancing data management and decision-making at Axon.

Project Implementation Steps to Solve the Capstone Project

Data Extraction and Cleaning: Extracting data from the designated sources, I performed data cleaning tasks, including removing duplicates, handling missing values, and ensuring data consistency.

Data Loading: The cleaned and modeled data was loaded into PowerBI using appropriate features, and I meticulously documented all data loading and transformation steps.

Data Modeling: To optimize data structure for analysis, I created a data model within PowerBI, establishing relationships between tables.
